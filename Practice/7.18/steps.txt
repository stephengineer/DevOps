Step 1: Pull a Docker image and create files in it
1. Stop all the active running containers and ensure that no containers are running in detach mode
2. Pull a new ubuntu image from Docker Hub
$ docker pull ubuntu
3. Check if it has been pulled and is available 
docker ps -a
4. Now, run the docker container
docker run  -itd ubuntu
5. Check if the docker container is up and running
docker ps
6. Now, log in to the ubuntu instance 
docker exec -it <container_ID> bash
7. Create a folder and files in it
mkdir test1 test2
cd test1
touch hello.txt hello.html hello.py
8. Check if the files have been created
ls -lart
9. Exit the container using CTRL+D


Step 2: Log in at DockerHub
1. Create an account in DockerHub https://hub.docker.com/ and log in. Execute the commands mentioned below to log in at DockerHub through your terminal:
docker login â€“-username=<Your_username> --password=<Your_password>
2. Create another replicated image of Ubuntu
docker commit <Image_ID> <your_DockerHub_username>/tag


Step 3: Deploy the image to DockerHub
1. Check if it has been created
docker images
2. Now, push it to DockerHub
docker push <Repository/Image>
3. Go to your DockerHub account and reload the page. You should be able to see the image pushed from the terminal
