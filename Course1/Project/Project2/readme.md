# Deploy Angular Application in Docker Container

DESCRIPTION

Deploy the Angular application in Docker. The Angular application should be built with the Angular CLI along with Docker Compose for development and production.

## Problem Statement Scenario:

HTQual Technology Solutions hired you as a MEAN Stack Developer. The organization decided to implement DevOps to develop and deliver the products. Since HTQual is an Agile organization, they follow Scrum methodology to develop the projects incrementally. The Company decided to develop their website on Mean stack. Since you are the MEAN stack developer, you have to demonstrate that deploying an Angular application on Docker is always a best approach to develop a project and test it incrementally. You agreed upon the following:

* Setting up an image for code development
* Build the application in Docker and host it in Docker Hub
* List the advantages, disadvantages, and document the tasks involved

Your goal is to demonstrate the Angular application and run it in a Docker container.

## You must use the following tools:

* Docker – To package the application in a Docker container
* Node.js – To support the Angular application with the required node modules.
* Angular CLI – To execute and bundle the dependencies together.
* Linux (Ubuntu) – As a base operating system to start and execute the project.

## Following requirements should be met:

* Document the step-by-step process from the initial installation to the final production.
* Run the Angular application successfully in the Docker container.
* Use Docker Compose to manage the Angular application running inside the Docker container.
